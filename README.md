# Overview of Discrete Mathmatics
Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. This means it deals with objects that can be counted individually, such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic, rather than continuous systems like real numbers or calculus.  
Here are some key areas within discrete mathematics:
* Combinatorics: This involves counting, arrangement, and combination of sets of elements. It includes topics like permutations, combinations, and the Pigeonhole Principle.
* Graph Theory: This is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. It includes concepts like vertices, edges, paths, and cycles.
* Logic: This area focuses on formal systems of reasoning. It includes propositional logic, predicate logic, and Boolean algebra.
* Set Theory: This is the study of sets, which are collections of objects. It includes operations on sets, Venn diagrams, and the concept of cardinality.
* Number Theory: This involves the study of integers and integer-valued functions. Topics include divisibility, prime numbers, and modular arithmetic.
* Algorithms and Complexity: This area deals with the design and analysis of algorithms, as well as the study of computational complexity, which classifies problems based on their inherent difficulty.
* Discrete Probability: This involves the study of probability where the set of possible outcomes is discrete. It includes topics like probability distributions, expected value, and variance.  
Discrete mathematics is foundational for computer science, as it provides the mathematical underpinnings for data structures, algorithms, and cryptography
